Instructions:
	Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
	Prepare two 8-inch round baking pans.
	Beat the sugar, oil, vanilla and eggs in mixer until it is a light yellow.
	In a separate bowl sift together flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, and salt.
	With the mixer on low speed, slowly and gently add in the dry ingredients. Mix until JUST combined.
	Remove bowl from mixer and fold raisins, nuts, carrots, and pineapple.
	Divide the batter equally between the pans. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.
	Allow the cakes to cool completely on a wire rack.
	Cover in cream cheese frosting.

	Tips for this cake:
	Once you have added the flour to the wet ingredients you want to be very gentle with the batter. You could even remove the bowl from the stand mixer and mix all dry ingredients in by hand!
	If you do not want to add pineapple, you can add 1/4 more oil and omit the pineapple. You can also make other substitutions or changes like adding sweetened coconut (1/4 cup should do!) or using a little brown sugar.
	Allow the cakes to cool completely in the pans before assembling cake. I like to use a chilled cake for assembly and a room-temperature frosting. You may need to level your cake prior to assembly. Get detailed instructions on that here.
