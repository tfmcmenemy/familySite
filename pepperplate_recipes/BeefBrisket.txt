Instructions:
	Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Coat a roasting pan with cooking spray. Place brisket in roasting pan.
	In a large bowl, combine remaining ingredients. Pour over brisket, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake about 3 hours, or until meat is fork-tender. Slice brisket across grain and serve with pan drippings.
	Note
	If you want to make this in advance, just put the sliced brisket back into the pan of drippings, cover, and keep refrigerated. Reheat it in the oven before serving.
