Ingredients:
	2 tsp. unflavored gelatin
	2 Tbsp. cold water
	1/4 c. boiling water
	1/2 c. sugar
	2 Tbsp. cocoa powder (for a more intense chocolate flavor, add 1 additional Tbsp.)
	1 1/2 c. heavy cream, very cold
	1/2 c. Baileys Irish Cream, very cold
	1 tsp. vanilla

Instructions:
	*Before beginning, prep bowl and beaters by placing in the freezer for 15-20 minutes to chill.*
	Sprinkle gelatin over cold water in small bowl; stir and let stand 1 minute to soften.
	Add boiling water; stir until gelatin is completely dissolved. Let stand to cool.
	Stir together sugar and cocoa in a large mixing bowl; add heavy cream.
	Beat at medium-high speed until stiff peaks form; gradually pour in Baileys, vanilla, and gelatin mixture, beating continuously at high speed until well-blended and soft peaks form.
