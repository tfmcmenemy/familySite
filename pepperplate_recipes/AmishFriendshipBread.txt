Ingredients:
	FOR THE “STARTER”:
	⅓ cups sugar
	⅓ cups flour
	⅓ cups lukewarm milk, 90-100 F (32-38 C)
	10 g (3 tsp) fresh yeast or 4-5 g (1 tsp) active dry yeast or 0.3 g (3/4 tsp) instant yeast
	FOR THE BREAD:
	2 cups all-purpose flour
	1 cup white sugar
	2 teaspoons baking powder
	1 teaspoon baking soda
	1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
	1 teaspoon salt
	3 eggs
	2/3 cup vegetable oil
	1 tablespoon vanilla extract
	1 cup chopped nuts
	2 apples – peeled, cored, chopped

Instructions:
	FOR THE “STARTER”: In a small bowl, combine ingredients for the starter. Place the bowl in a warm (not hot) location, free from drafts. Wait for about 10 minutes or until yeast activates – it will become foamy and show signs of expansion.
	FOR THE BREAD: Combine together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
	In a large mixing bowl, mix together the “starter”, eggs, oil and vanilla. Stir in the sifted ingredients and mix until just blended (do not overmix). Finally stir in the chopped apples and nuts. Divide the batter evenly between two lightly greased and floured 9×5 inch loaf pans.
	Bake in 350 F (175 C) preheated oven for 50 minutes. Check for doneness with a toothpick inserted into the center of a loaf – it has to come out clean.
