Ingredients:
	4 Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast Halves
	Kosher Salt, to taste
	Ground Black Pepper, to taste
	2 Tablespoons Butter, divided
	2 Tablespoons Olive Oil, divided
	2 Cups Sliced Mushrooms (about 1/2 pound)
	2 cloves Garlic, minced
	1 Cup Marsala Wine
	1 Cup Chicken broth
	1/2 Cup Heavy Cream
	1/4 Cup Chopped Fresh Parsley (Optional) (garnish)

Instructions:
	Place the chicken breast halves between two sheets of plastic wrap or in a resealable freezer bag on a solid, level surface. Use the smooth side of a meat mallet or a rolling pin to pound the chicken into an even ½-inch thickness. Season the chicken with salt and ground black pepper.
	In a large skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add the chicken and cook it for 2-4 minutes per side, or until it's golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken and set it aside.
	Increase the heat to medium high and add the butter and olive oil to the pan. Sauté the mushrooms for 2-3 minutes or until they're starting to brown.
	Add the minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute or until it's fragrant.
	Add the Marsala wine, bring it to a simmer, and cook for 1-2 minutes.
	Add the chicken broth and heavy whipping cream and bring it to a simmer. Reduce the sauce for 5-10 minutes, or until it starts to thicken.
	Add the chicken back into the pan, coat each side with sauce, and cook it for 1-2 minutes until it's heated through. Serve the Marsala chicken warm with pasta, mashed potatoes, or veggies.
