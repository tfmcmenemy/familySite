Ingredients:
	1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
	1 teaspoon baking soda
	1/2 teaspoon baking powder
	1 teaspoon cinnamon
	1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
	1/2 cup light brown sugar
	3 medium bananas, mashed
	1/2 cup carrots, grated
	1/2 cup almond milk
	1 teaspoon vanilla
	1/2 cup rolled oats, divided
	Pinch of salt
	1/4 cup raw walnuts, chopped (optional)

Instructions:
	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
	Mash the bananas in a large bowl, then add the vanilla and almond milk and mix everything with a fork. Whisk in the brown sugar and mix until no clumps are left.
	Sift the dry ingredients together in a medium bowl, and then fold the banana mixture into it in separate parts. Then, gently fold the carrots into the mixture and most of the rolled oats save a few tablespoons for topping.
	Fill muffin cups or lightly greased tins about 3/4 of the way, and then sprinkle with the remaining rolled oats and walnuts.
	Bake for about 30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean when poked into the center of a muffin.
