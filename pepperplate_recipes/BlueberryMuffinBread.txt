Ingredients:
	1/2 cup butter, room temperature
	3/4 cup sugar
	1 egg
	2 teaspoons vanilla
	2 cups flour
	2 teaspoons baking powder
	1 tablespoon milk, more as needed
	1 teaspoon kosher salt
	1/2 cup buttermilk
	2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
	1/2 cup powdered sugar

Instructions:
	Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9x5 loaf pan.
	In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and vanilla until well combined.
	Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl.
	Add the flour mixture a little at a time to the butter mixture, alternating with the buttermilk.
	Fold in the blueberries.
	Bake for 50-60 minutes or until a butter knife inserted in the center comes out mostly clean.
	Cool before glazing.
	To make the glaze, whisk together the powdered sugar and milk. Add more milk if you'd like the glaze thinner.
	Drizzle over the bread before cutting.
