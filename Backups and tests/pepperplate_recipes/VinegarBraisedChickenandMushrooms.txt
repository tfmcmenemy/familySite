Ingredients:
	4 pounds assorted bone-in, skin on chicken pieces (breasts and thighs)
	2 pounds mushrooms (cremini, white, or baby bella), cleaned of any dirt or particles
	2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
	3/4 cup balsamic vinegar
	1/4 cup red wine vinegar
	1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
	5 carrots, peeled and roughly chopped (could use baby carrots)
	3 cloves garlic, crushed
	1 yellow onion, chopped
	1 bay leaf
	3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
	2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
	kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste

Instructions:
	Season both sides of chicken generously with salt and pepper.
	Heat olive oil in a large cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat and, in batches, brown chicken on all sides, then transfer to a separate plate and set aside.
	Reserving 2-3 tablespoons, drain off fat and saute carrots and onions until tender. About 10 minutes.
	Add mushrooms and cook for another 6-8 minutes, or until softened, then add crushed garlic and saute for 2 minutes.
	Season everything with salt and pepper, then transfer vegetables (discarding garlic) to the plate with the chicken.
	Sprinkle flour into the Dutch oven and cook for 1-2 minutes, whisking continuously, until pasty and smooth.
	Pour in the vinegars and whisk until smooth. Cook mixture for 3-5 minutes, or until thickened and reduced, then slowly mix in chicken broth.
	Return chicken to pot and add bay leaf, then bring mixture to a boil.
	Reduce heat to low, partially cover your pot and let simmer for 35-40 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through.
	Return vegetables to Dutch oven and serve with reduced sauce.
