	Preheat the oven to 500°F. Spray a large rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray.
	Combine the bread crumbs, paprika, fennel seeds, celery seeds, onion powder, salt, garlic powder, and pepper on a piece of wax paper; set aside.
	Place the pork chops between sheets of wax paper. Pound them to 1⁄4-inch thickness using the smooth side of a meat mallet or the bottom of a heavy, large saucepan.
	Place the buttermilk in a shallow bowl. Dip the chops in the buttermilk, then coat both sides with the bread crumb mixture. Place the chops on the prepared baking sheet and put in the preheating oven. Bake until browned and cooked through, about 12 minutes. Yields 1 chop per serving
