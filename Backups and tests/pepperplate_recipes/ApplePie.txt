Ingredients:
[Pastry]
	2 cups sifted flour
	3/4 cup butter or margerine
	4 1/2 tbs. ice water
	Mix flour and butter in food processor or with pastry blender until grainy; add ice water; mix until it forms a ball; refrigerate for a while. Roll a bit more than 1/2 for bottom crust between 2 pieces of wax paper or circular pie shaper; put in pie plate.

[Filling]
	6 cups pared sliced apples
	3/4 cups (plus a bit more) sugar
	1 tbs cornstarch
	1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
	walnuts or raisins optional
	Simmer the apples and other filling ingredients with about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of water for a few minutes. Don't add too much water; you just want enough so you DON'T BURN THEM (ha ha). Before you put the filling in the pie plate mix about a tablespoon of sugar and flour together and spread on top of the bottom crust in the plate. This should keep the bottom crust from getting soggy. Put the filling ingredients into the pie plate on top of crust. Roll top crust and place on top. Seal crusts with prong tips of fork and make 4 vent holes/slits on top. Bake at 425 for 15 minutes and then 350 for about 45 minutes to an hour. Enjoy.
