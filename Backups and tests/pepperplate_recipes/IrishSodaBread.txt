Ingredients:
	4 cups flour
	4 tablespoons sugar
	1 tablespoon baking powder
	1 teaspoon salt
	3/4 teaspoon baking soda
	6 tablespoons butter or margerine
	1 1/2 cups raisins
	2 eggs
	1 1/2 cups buttermilk

Instructions:
	Preheat oven to 350; grease well a round casserole. In a large bowl, with fork mix first 5 ingredients. With pastry blender or 2 knives used scissor fashion, cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs; stir in raisins
	In a small bowl, with fork, beat eggs slightly, remove 2 tablespoon and reserve; stir buttermilk into remaining egg; stir into flour mixture just until flour is moistened (dough will be sticky).
	Turn dough onto well floured surface; with floured hands knead about 10 strokes to mix thoroughly. (Dough will be quite sticky - you might have to scrape dough off your hands with spatula - flour your hands and work surface good). Shape dough into a ball; place in casserole. In center of ball, with sharp knife dipped in flour, cut a 4 inch (just guess) cross about 1/4 inch deep. Brush dough with reserved egg.
	Bake dough about 1 hour and 20 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. (I have always found this time to be exact. I just set my timer and take it out when the buzzer goes off.) Cool on wire rack a few minutes; remove from casserole and cool completely on rack.
