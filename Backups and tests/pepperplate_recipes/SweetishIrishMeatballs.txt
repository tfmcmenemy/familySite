Ingredients:
	3 slices of bread (crumbled)
	Some minced onion - eye measure it
	1/4 teaspoon pepper
	1 1/2 teaspoon salt
	1/4 plus a bit more ground nutmeg
	bit of milk to soak bread in - maybe about 1/2 cup
	2 lbs chopped meat
	4 tbs margerine or butter
	flour for thickening
	beef broth (I prefer to use the beef granules so i can use the amount I want)
	(just use a spoonful or so with a cup of water, but then you can also
	shake more into your sauce)
	1/2 and 1/2

Instructions:
	Combine bread, onion, pepper, nutmeg and milk in a large bowl. Let stand ten minutes.
	Stir in meat until well blended. Form into 1 1/2 inch balls.
	Brown in margerine; remove with picker or slotted spoon. Pour away grease, but keep crusting.
	Pour some 1/2 and 1/2 into the pan and work the crustings loose.
	Then thicken some more 1/2 and 1/2 and pour it into pan with some beef flavoring that has been diluted in water or use prepared beef broth
	When sauce is thick enough return meatballs to the sauce and simmer on a very low light for about 20 minutes or so.
	You might have to thicken the sauce more as you cook it. If you do MAKE SURE YOU PUT THE FLOUR INTO THE COLD 1/2 AND 1/2 AND WHEN YOU HAVE IT SMOOTH ADD SOME HOT LIQUID TO THE COLD AND THEN PUT IT IN THE PAN. If you do not do this, the flour will form lumps. I usually don't measure the flour, 1/2 and 1/2 or beef boullion. I just work at it until I like the way it is.
