Ingredients:
	1/4 cup butter, softened
	1/4 cup vegetable oil
	1/2 cup granulated sugar
	1/3 cup brown sugar
	2 tablespoons thawed apple juice concentrate
	2 eggs
	1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
	1/4 teaspoon baking soda
	Pinch of nutmeg
	1 teaspoon cinnamon
	3/4 teaspoon salt
	2 2/3 cups unbleached, all-purpose flour
	1 cup milk
	3 tablespoons butter (for topping)
	6 tablespoons cinnamon sugar

Instructions:
	Preheat oven to 425°F (375°F if using a dark, non-stick tin). Place baking cups in a 12-cup muffin tin and lightly grease the insides. Set aside.
	In the bowl of a stand mixer, thoroughly whisk together butter, oil, sugars and apple juice concentrate. Add eggs, beating to combine, until mixture is smooth. Stir in baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, cinnamon and salt.
	Add the flour to the butter mixture alternately with the milk, starting and ending with the flour. Stir to combine well.
	Spoon or scoop batter evenly into muffin cups. Bake until a toothpick inserted into one of the center muffins comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool 10 minutes.
	Melt butter for topping. Dip the tops of each muffin into the butter, then roll in the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Place on a cooling rack to cool completely.
