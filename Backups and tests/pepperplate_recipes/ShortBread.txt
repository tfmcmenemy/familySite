Ingredients:
	1 pound of salted butter softened
	1 1/2 cups sugar
	4 cups flour

Instructions:
	Make sure butter is nice and soft.
	Mix butter and sugar together very well.
	After it is mixed well add flour.
	After all flour is well mixed into the butter/sugar mix put the dough on a pan. My shortbread pan is about 10"X15"X1". Spread it out nice and even.
	With a fork dipped in flour pierce the dough in the pan thoroughly to let steam escapt, and press the fork prongs around the outside for the cruse.
	Bake at 350 for about 40 minutes at the most or until it is nicely browned. Check on it after 25minutes.
	When you take it out of the oven IMMEDIATELY shake regular sugar on it and cut while it it still warm. Take pieces off cooking tray to cool on a metal rack.
